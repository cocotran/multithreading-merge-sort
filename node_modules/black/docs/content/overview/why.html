§§ blurb

While JavaScript could be regarded as a functional language, it lacks
lots of utilities to deal with objects in a functional style. Black
attempts to fix it by providing functions to deal with sequences,
objects and other core objects the functional way.

§§ /blurb

The main goal here is really to provide such missing functionality, and
wrap the existing one so it's more generic (ie.: while the functional
array utilities are cool, they're bound to the Array `Prototype`'s,
which is not nice when you want to use them for non-array objects).

The second goal is to fix the naming convention to something more
sane. Sorry people, but camelCase sucks way too much to be taken
seriously. Also, some of the API methods have insanely long and overly
verbose names, which is also not nice — for readability, it doesn't
really matter for writing[^1].

The third goal is to do this all with performance in mind. Surely
everything could be implemented as a matter of function composition, but
that's not always practical. So, performance will be chosen over theory
neatness all the time.


[^1]:  camelCase and verbosity leads to lots of *"Write
       once. **Run.** Everywhere."* code. If you don't value your eyes,
       whatever. I do value mine though.
