§§ blurb

The `obj` module introduces lots of features missing from the standard
as well as some aliases. The primary focus is to treat objects as sets
of properties, and provide functions to manipulate these sets in a pure
way (mostly).

§§ /blurb

This module depends on the [type][] module.

## Unpacking

By loading the `core` module you can [unpack][] this module's functions to
use them in a less crippled way.

The module will unpack generic functions over to the `Object`
constructor, own methods inside `Object.prototype`, so that all created
objects will get them, and utilities in the usual global object.

The following functions are exported as utilities:

- [extend](#function_extend)
- [keys](#function_keys)
- [own_props](#function_own_props)
- [values](#function_values)
- [items](#function_items)
- [proto](#function_proto)
- [get](#function_get)
- [set_default](#function_set_default)

## Information about an object

### Function hasp

    (obj:Object, key:String) ↦ Boolean
    
Checks if a key is defined directly in an object. That is, if the given
`key` is an **own** property of the object.


### Function emptyp

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean
    
Checks if an object has any **own** enumerable properties.

Own properties are properties defined directly in the object, rather
than inherited from the prototype. This function consider empty any
object that has no such properties.

For example, the following object is empty:

~~~js~~~
>>> var emptyp = black.obj.emptyp

// empty literal is empty
>>> emptyp({ })

// so is a newly constructed native Object, given the constructor hasn't
been touched, that is.
>>> emptyp(new Object)
~~~~~~~~

Objects that only inherit properties from their prototypes are also
considered empty. That's kinda given with the literal notation, since
the resulting object inherits properties from `Object.prototype`. In any
case, that holds true for any other kind of object.

~~~js~~~
>>> var my_object = Object.create({ foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar' })
>>> emptyp(my_object)
true
~~~~~~~~

Objects with own properties, but non-enumerables are not considered,
since you can't backport such checks to non ECMAScript 5
platforms. Therefore, the following object is also considered empty:

~~~js~~~
>>> var my_object = { }
>>> Object.defineProperty(my_object, 'foo', { value: 'bar' })
>>> emptyp(my_object)
true

// The property is defined directly (own) in the object nonetheless
>>> my_object.hasOwnProperty('foo')
true
~~~~~~~~

### Function size

    (obj:Object) ↦ Number
    
Returns the number of **own enumerable** properties in the object.

This will count any property defined directly in the object (enumerable
properties, that is), whether they have a value or not.


### Function proto

    (obj:Object) ↦ Object
    
Returns the internal `〖Prototype〗` of the object.

The `〖Prototype〗` is an internal reference to an object, from which
the current object inherits its behaviours. For example, in the case of
a simple object literal: `{}`; its `〖Prototype〗` points to
`Object.prototype`.

This is a direct alias of [Object.getPrototypeOf][]

[Object.getPrototypeOf]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/GetPrototypeOf


## Key and property lists

### Function keys

    (obj:Object) ↦ Array
    
Returns a list of all **own enumerable** property names in an object.

This is a direct alias of [Object.keys][]

[Object.keys]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys


### Function own_props

    (obj:Object) ↦ Array
    
Returns a list of all **own** property names in an object, enumerable or
not.

This is a direct alias of [Object.getOwnPropertyNames][]

**Warning**
> This function can't be back-ported to implementations that don't
> support ECMAScript 5.

**See also:**

- [keys](#function_keys)


### Function values

    (obj:Object) ↦ Array

Return a list of values for all **own enumerable** properties
of an object.

**Example:**

~~~js~~~
>>> var my_object = { foo: 1, bar: 2 }
>>> black.obj.values(my_object)
[1, 2]
~~~~~~~~

### Function items

    (obj:Object) ↦ Array
    
Return a list of tuples (key/value pairs) for all **own enumerable**
properties of an object.

**Example:**

~~~js~~~
>>> var my_object = { foo: 1, bar: 2 }
>>> black.obj.items(my_object)
[['foo', 1]
,['bar', 2]]
~~~~~~~~


## Properties of an object

### Function get

    (obj:Object, key:String[, default][, pred:Function]) ↦ *mixed*
    
Return the given property in the object.

If the property with the given key cannot be found, it'll return the
value passed in as `default`, otherwise undefined.

A predicate function may be passed to the function to fine-tuning how
checking for the validity of the property. By default, the function does
an existence check `key in object`, but this also considers properties
that get inherited from other objects via the prototype chain.

The predicate could be used to, for example, allow only properties
defined directly in the object, or only properties of a certain type to
be considered valid.

In any case, the predicate function is called with three parameters: the
value stored in the key (a `*mixed*`), the key itself (a `String`) and
a reference to the object.

**Example:**
~~~js~~~
>>> function ownp(value, key, obj) { return obj.hasOwnProperty(key) }
>>> var get = black.obj.get
>>> var obj1 = { bar: 2 }
>>> var obj2 = Object.create(obj1, { foo: { value: 1 }})
>>> get(obj1, 'bar')
2
>>> get(obj2, 'bar')
2
>>> get(obj2, 'bar', '--bar--', ownp)
'--bar--'
~~~~~~~~


### Function pop

    (obj:Object, key:String[, default][pred:Function]) ↦ *mixed*
   
Removes the property from the object, then return the value of the
property.

Pop works similarly to [get](#function_get), with the single difference
that it'll also remove the property from the object if it exists.

**warning:** *side-effects*
> The property is **actually removed** from the given object.

**See also:**

- [get](#function_get)


### Function set_default

    (obj:Object, key:String, value[, pred:Function]) ↦ *mixed*
    
Sets the property only if it doesn't already exist in the object (or
does not pass the predicate test for that matter). Returns the new value
of the property.

The default behaviour considers only properties that exist in the
object, through the [hasp](#function_hasp) function. The behaviour can
be changed by providing a custom predicate function.

If a predicate is given, it'll be called with three parameters: the
value stored in the property, the property name and a reference to the
object itself.

The predicate is expected to return true if the property is considered
valid, and therefore shouldn't be changed, and false otherwise.

**Example:**


## Structure handling and modifying

### Function nextend

    (target:Object, sources:Object...) ↦ Object
    
Extends an object with the **own enumerable** properties of multiple
source objects, then return the first object passed to the function.

**Warning:** *side-effects*
> The `target` object is modified in-place.

**See also:**

- [extend](#function_extend) - The pure version of this function.


### Function extend

    (target:Object, sources:Object...) ↦ Object
    
Extends an object with the **own enumerable** properties of multiple
source objects, then return the first object passed to the function.

The `target` object is not touched. An entirely new object will be
created, though it will not inherit neither the prototype nor the
non-enumerable properties of the object.


### Function copy

    (obj:Object) ↦ Object
    
Creates a shallow copy of the object.

Currently, just an alias for [extend](#function_extend), though the idea
is that it'll support deep copies on the 1.0 release.
