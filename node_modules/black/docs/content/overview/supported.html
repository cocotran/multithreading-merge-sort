§§ blurb

Black should work in any ECMAScript 5-compliant environment — like Node.js,
Chrome and Firefox. Just load it and hack away.

§§ /blurb


§§ deps

You can run it in non-ECMAScript 5-compliant environments by supplying the
appropriate fallbacks. Since black does not rely on any method that can't be
implemented in pure JavaScript, it should be doable.

If you don't want to reinvent the wheel, you can just load the awesome
[ES5-shim][] library.

§§ /deps


Tests have been done only on v8 as of now, but they'll be done in other
environments as soon as I port Claire over to something other than
Node.js.
