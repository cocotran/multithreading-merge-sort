## Unpacking

By loading the `core` module you can [unpack][] this module's functions
to use them in a less crippled way.

All generic functions in the `fn` module are exported as utilities,
generic methods are exported to the `Function` constructor, and own
methods in the `Function.prototype` object.


[unpack]: core.html#unpacking_functions_and_own_methods


## Generic functions

### Function partial

    (fn:Function, args...) ↦ Function
    
Returns a function that'll always have the given arguments prepended to
the function's argument list.


### Function delay

    (fn:Function, seconds:Number) ↦ Number
    
Calls the function after the given number of seconds.

Returns the ID of the timer, such that the call to the function can be
cancelled by passing that ID to `clearTimeout`.


### Function defer

    (fn:Function) ↦ Number
    
Same as [delay](#function_delay), but calls the function as soon as the
engine is not busy doing other things.


### Function wrap

    (fn:Function[, wrapper:Function]) ↦ Function
    
Returns a function that passes the given `wrapper` as the first argument
for `fn`.
