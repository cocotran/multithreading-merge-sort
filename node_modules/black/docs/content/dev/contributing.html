§§ blurb

Black is a part of the [OrpheOS][] project and a [free software][][^1]
project (**not** associated to the FSF, though). As such, we really welcome
contributions of any sort to the project:

[^1]: Note that my views on freedom differ a little from Stallman's. I
      believe freedom cannot be enforced, and therefore am not
      comfortable with the GPL licence. Even if the terms in the licence
      are intended to guarantee the user's freedom (and it does great in
      that).
      
      But well, I'm just a bit too much of an idealist ;3


## Writing documentation and tutorials

Documentation is good. Tutorials are good. No, seriously, they are the
**good**, and most of the time overlooked. Good documentation is
essential for any software that's meant to be used by someone.

There's no rule for writing about the project elsewhere, of course. But
for writing documentation that you want to include in the project's
distribution, there are a few guidelines to follow:

-   All documentation is written in [Markdown][]. [Hyde][] is used to
    generate the HTML files from all the markdown, and it uses
    [python markdown][] library for rendering.
    

-   API documentation should follow Calliope's guidelines. Basically,
    the API documentation consists of the documented item as a header, a
    piece of plain text with the function's signature, if it's a
    function, and a description of what the function does, along with
    any additional information, warnings and such:
    
        ## Function something
    
            (times:Number) ↦ Number
        
        Do something the given number of `times`.

-   Code examples should follow OrpheOS's [javascript style-guide][].

## Filling bug reports

The project uses Github [tracker][] for tracking bugs, features and
such. All tickets are assigned a developer and a milestone to be
properly addressed.

Bug reports should contain at least the following information:

-   **What the problem is**

    > A short description of what is happening.
    
-   **What is the intended behaviour**

    > A short descripton of what **should** be happening.

-   **JavaScript environment and version**

    > The environment where the script has failed to execute
    > properly. Might be a Browser (IE, Firefox, Opera, Chrome...), or a
    > server-side environment (Node.js, RingoJS, Narwhal, ...).
    
-   **OS and OS version**

    > The operating system where the environment was being ran.
    
-   **All steps necessary to reproduce the issue**

    > Really, this is one of the most essential information of all, and
    > will really help the bug to be sorted out quicker.
    
Before reporting a bug, please take a little time to search the bug
tracker and see whether that issue has been addressed before or not. If
you can't do that, report the bug nonetheless. It's always better to
just mark the bug as duplicate latter than risk losing potential bug
reports :3

[tracker]: {{ project.tracker }}

## Requesting new features

Features are also requested as tickets in the Github's [tracker][]. When
requesting a new feature, just be sure to include a reasonable amount of
information on how the intended behaviour of the feature :3


## Writing patches

Patches are handled through pull requests. If you want to include a
patch, fork the project, do your changes, then send me a pull
request. It's interesting to include some information about which
changes you're doing in the pull request's description too.


## Writing test cases

Test cases should be written using the [Claire][] library. Inclusion in
the project follows the same guidelines of
[writing patches](#writing_patches), though.
