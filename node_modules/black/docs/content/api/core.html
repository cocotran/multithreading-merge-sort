After [properly installing][install] Black, you can move on to the
interesting part: actually using it. This page will get you started on
using the library and give you an overview of how it all fits
together. Each module has its own very specialised documentation too, of
course, don't forget to check those up.

[install]: ../overview/installing.html


## Using generic functions

Each module exports a good deal of generic functions to manipulate
JavaScript objects. Those functions usually receive the object that
should be manipulated as the first argument, and returns an entirely new
object as a result â€” that is, they're side-effect free functions.

Functions are properly namespaced under the `black` object. That is,
functions that deal with objects live inside `black.obj` rather than the
built-in `Object`. Functions that deal with sequences live inside
`black.list` and so on.

So, if you wanted to use the function `emptyp` to check if an object has
any properties, this is what you would do:

~~~js~~~
>>> var empty_object = { }
>>> black.obj.emptyp(empty_object)
true
~~~~~~~~


## Functions with predicates

Some functions might accept a filter function to control its output,
these filter functions are called predicates (or `pred` for
short). Predicate functions allow for generic functions to be even more
general, by giving the user more power.

For example, consider the built-in `Array.indexOf`. It performs a search
over a sequence comparing the given search value with each item using
the strict equality operator (`===`). But what if you wanted to find
some string inside a sequence regardless of it's case? Or if you wanted
to find the first value with a certain error margin from the given
search term? You'd have to write `Array.indexOf` from the scratch,
right?

Taking this limitation into consideration, you'll often see functions in
Black that accept predicate functions to control their output. For
example, `without` is a function that returns a list without the items
that match a given value, but you can specify what exactly a *"match"*
means with a predicate function:

~~~js~~~
>>> var fruits = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Lemons"]
>>> function caseless_compare(str1, str2) {
...     return str1.toLowerCase() === str2.toLowerCase()
... }
>>> black.list.without(fruits, "apples", caseless_compare)
["Oranges", "Lemons"]
~~~~~~~~


## Unpacking functions and own methods

`black.obj.this`, `black.list.that`, sure it's annoying having to type
all that everywhere, right? While aliasing the functions would fix it,
50 lines of aliases at the start of every script is not a nice thing
either.

To solve this Black's core module implements unpacker functions. These
allow to batch export the contents of each module to a more usable
object.

Black uses three special properties in each module to define how they
are unpacked:

â€» overview/installing.html as installing

{{ installing.special }}

So, to make all generic functions in the `black` package available in
JavaScript's built-in constructors (as a constructor function), you'd
use:

~~~js~~~
>>> black.unpack_all(['generic'])
>>> Object.emptyp
[Function emptyp]
~~~~~~~~

To make all the generic functions available in the built-in prototypes,
as instance methods, you'd use:

~~~js~~~
>>> black.unpack_all(['own'])
>>> var empty_obj = {}
>>> empty_obj.emptyp()
true
~~~~~~~~

And finally, to export all module utilities into the global scope:

~~~js~~~
>>> black.unpack_all(['utils'])
>>> first(range(1, 10))
1
~~~~~~~~
