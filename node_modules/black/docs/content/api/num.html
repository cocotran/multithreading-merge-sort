§§ blurb

The `num` module provides a few numeric and mathematical functions.

§§ /blurb

This module has no dependencies.

## Unpacking

By loading the `core` module you can [unpack][] this module's functions
to use them in a less crippled way.

All generic functions in the `num` module are exported as utilities,
generic methods are exported to the `Number` constructor, and own
methods in the `Number.prototype` object.


[unpack]: core.html#unpacking_functions_and_own_methods


## Generic functions

### Function clamp

    (num:Number, min:Number, max:Number) ↦ Number
   
Returns the neares number within the given boundaries.


### Function wrap

    (num:Number, min:Number, max:Number) ↦ Number
    
Keeps a number within the given boundaries, but it fhe given number
exceeds it, it wraps around.

So, if you call `wrap(2, 5, 10)` you'll get `7`, as `2` is 3 units from
the minimum value, that difference is reduced from the other end.

**FIXME:**
> Come up with a description that does not suck monkey balls.


### Function snap

    (num:Number, step:Number) ↦ Number
    
Snaps the number to the nearest number in the arithmetic progression
defined by the `step` increment.


### Function pad

    (num:Number, size:Number) ↦ String
    
Prefixes a number with zeroes, such that it always has the given size.
