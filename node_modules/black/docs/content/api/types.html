§§ blurb

The type module introduces utilities for checking types and common
interfaces of JavaScript objects. It doesn't attempt to bring
some kind of `is-a` programming flow to JavaScript, both because the
language is not fit for this, and because I think `is-a` is broken by
design.

At any rate, the type checking utilities are separated into three main
categories: Type checking, interface testing and functionality testing.

This module does not depend on any other Black module.

## Unpacking

By loading the `core` module you can [unpack][] this module's functions
to use them in a less crippled way.

All generic functions in the `type` module are exported as utilities,
and these generic functions are also exported inside `Object`.

None of the functions are exported into the prototype.

## Type checking

The type checking utilities let you be explicit about what kind of data
structure you want to handle. These functions rely mostly on the
`〖Class〗` internal property of each object, as defined by the
ECMAScript specs.


### Function class_of

    (obj:Object) ↦ String

Returns the internal `〖Class〗` of the given object.



### Function nilp

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean

Checks if the object points to nothing valid.

ECMAScript defines two different values for denoting `invalid`, which
are used differently according to the context. They are: `null` and
`undefined`.

`null` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, and usually used to replace
a previously valid value with an invalid reference, that is, explicitly
saying that a name does not care about the old value it stored.

`undefined` is not a reserved keyword, and is used to denote that a name
hasn't been initialised yet. It's the value of a variable declared
without an initial value, the value of a parameter that hasn't been
given at the time a function was called, and the return value of a
function that has no explicit return values, among others.


### Function not_nilp

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean

Checks if the object points to something valid.

The exact opposite of [nilp](#function_nilp). Will return true for
anything that's neither `undefined` nor `null`.


### Function undefp

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean

Checks if the object is `undefined`.


### Function strp

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean

Checks if the object is a `String`.

Returns true for any string object, either a primitive (`"foo"`) or an
actual String object (`new String("foo")`). Depends on the internal
`〖Class〗` of the object.


### Function nump

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean

Checks if the object is a `Number`.

Returns true for any number object, either a primitive (`42`) or an
actual Number object (`new Number(42)`). Depends on the internal
`〖Class〗` of the object.


### Function boolp

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean

Checks if the object is a `Boolean`.

Returns true for any boolean object, either a primitive (`true`) or an
actual Boolean object (`new Boolean(true)`). Depends on the internal
`〖Class〗` of the object.


### Function regexpp

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean

Checks if the object is a `RegExp`.

Depends on the internal `〖Class〗` of the object.


### Function fnp

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean

Checks if the object is a `Function`.

Depends on the internal `〖Class〗` of the object.


### Function objp

Checks if the object is an actual object.

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean

This basically checks if the given object is neither a primitive nor an
invalid value, but will return true for anything else (even if their
`〖Class〗` is not `Object`).


### Function listp

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean

Checks if something is an actual array.

This is just an alias to the ECMAScript 5's `Array.isArray`
function. What ES calls array, Black calls Lists, basically.


## Interface testing

Interfaces define a small set of common behaviour that is expected from
an object. Testing for interfaces allows you to safely use an object,
while still not caring about the entire underlying data it uses. For
example, if you want a numeric value for the area of a circle, you don't
need to know if the data structure that stores the number is a byte, a
word, an integer, a float or whatever — you just need it to behave like
a number.


### Function callablep

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean
      
Checks if the object can be called as a function.

JavaScript does not allow you to define which objects are callable at
will. You can't just decide that your old `persons` array will now, when
called as a function, pop and return the first item.

Some implementations, however, allows you to call other objects other
than function, like the RegExp object:

~~~js~~~
>>> has_foop  = /foo/("foobar")
true
// => the same as /foo/.test("foobar")
~~~~~~~~


### Function numericp

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean
      
Checks if the object can be used as a number.

A numeric object is something that does not evaluate to
`NaN`. Therefore, a String that holds a numeric value, and a list with a
single numeric element are often considered numeric.

Though this depends on different factors as well. Objects can implement
the `valueOf` method, which determines which primitive value they
represent. Any object can be considered numeric, as long as the
`valueOf` method returns something that isn't `NaN`:

~~~js~~~
>>> var x = [1]
>>> numericp(x) // isNaN(x.join(","))
true
>>> x.valueOf = function(){ return "foo" }
>>> numericp(x) // isNaN("foo")
false
~~~~~~~~


### Function sequencep

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean
      
Checks if the object can be used as a JavaScript Array.

A sequence object is something that implements a `length` property and
numeric properties in the range of 0 to 2³², but not necessarily the
methods you'd see in `Array.prototype`. However, since most methods in
the `Array.prototype` are generic, they'll work as expected when applied
to such objects[^1].

Probably the most known example of a sequence object is the `arguments`
object, available for all functions.

Sequence objects work as expected with all the functions in the
`black.list` module.


[^1]: On old versions of JScript, some array-like host objects might
      give you an error when applying a Array function to them.


## Functionality testing

Functionality testing is an even looser and specific kind of testing
than the interface checks. It looks whether the object provides a
certain functionality or not, but does not check if the object provides
any other property to support such functionality — it is assumed there
isn't such dependency.

While these routines could indeed be placed within the interface testing
group, I guess putting them separately highlights their independence of
other properties in the object.


### Function sliceablep

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean
      
Checks if the object implements the `slice` method.


### Function searchablep

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean
      
Checks if the object implements search methods that return indexes.

Basically, we look for things that can be searched through the `indexOf`
and `lastIndexOf` methods. Though as previously stated, this method does
not asserts whether the implemented methods conform with ECMAScript 5's
`Array.{lastI,i}ndexOf` method.

Arrays and Strings are considered searchable.


### Function testablep

    (obj:Object) ↦ Boolean
      
Checks if the object implements a `test` method.

The primary intent of this method is to check the presence of a regexp
predicate, which takes a regexp and checks if the object matches that
regexp somehow, though it does not assert if the method conform with
this definition.
