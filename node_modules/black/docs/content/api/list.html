§§ blurb

The `list` module introduces functions to work with Arrays and other
general sequence objects, maintaining a pure way. They expand a little
on the JavaScript's Array methods, which are supposed to be generic, and
add a few more.

§§ /blurb

Note that this module relies on a correct ECMAScript implementation of
Array generics, which do take into account [sparse arrays][]. Note also
that some of the ES5 fallback libraries have
[issues with sparse arrays][] amongst other things.


This module depends on the [type][] module.

## Unpacking

By loading the `core` module you can [unpack][] this module's functions
to use them in a less crippled way.

The module will unpack generic functions to the `Array` constructor, own
methods inside `Array.prototype`, so that all arrays will get them (not
all sequence objects though), and utilities in the usual global object.

The following function are exported as utilities:

- [make_array](#function_make_array)
- [range](#function_range)
- [to_array](#function_to_array)
- [first](#function_first)
- [last](#function_last)
- [nth](#function_nth)
- [but_last](#function_but_last)
- [drop](#function_drop)
- [keep](#function_keep)
- [sorted](#function_sorted)
- [reversed](#function_reversed)
- [flatten](#function_flatten)
- [zip](#function_zip)
- [map](#function_map)
- [each](#function_each)
- [filter](#function_filter)
- [reduce](#function_reduce)
- [reduce_right](#function_reduce_right)
- [some](#function_some)
- [every](#function_every)
- [pluck](#function_pluck)
- [invoke](#function_invoke)

## Making lists

### Function make_array

    (size:Number[, default]) ↦ Array
    
Allocates an array with the given size, optionally filled with the
default value.

If a default value is not given, the array will be filled with empty
strings.


### Function range

    (start:Number, end:Number[, step:Number]) ↦ Array
    
Makes an array with numeric values ranging from `start` to `end`.

`end` is not included in the resulting array.


### Function to_array

    (obj:+Sequence) ↦ Array
    
Returns an *actual* array from any sequence object.


### Function copy

    (obj:+Sequence) ↦ Array
    
Returns a shallow copy of the sequence as an array.

Currently this does this by naïvely aliasing the
[slice](#function_slice) function. However, it still does not support
deep cloning.


## Information about a list and its elements

### Function size

    (seq:+Sequence) ↦ Number
    
Returns the size of a sequence.

Note that this is not the same as the number of elements inside an array
because JavaScript has things like [sparse arrays][], that is, arrays
where not all indexes are actually set.

Instead, it'll return the highest numeric index that is set in the
array (1-based)


### Function emptyp

    (seq:+Sequence) ↦ Boolean

Returns whether the sequence's size is larger than 0.


### Function hasp

    (seq:+Sequence, value[, predicate:Function]) ↦ Boolean

Checks if a sequence contains the given value or not.

The comparison is done using the strict equality comparison operator
(`===`), unless a different predicate function is given.

If a predicate function is given, it'll be called for each element in
the sequence with three parameters: the value of the sequence item, the
index that where that item is stored in the sequence, and the sequence
itself.

Note that the predicate function does not work with `null` values.

**See also:**

- [find_first](#function_find_first)


### Function count

    (seq:+Sequence, value[, predicate:Function]) ↦ Number

Returns the number of occurrences of `value` in the given sequence,
optionally filtered by a predicate function.

If a predicate function is not given, it'll check for occurrences using
the strict equality comparison operator (`===`). Otherwise, the function
will be called for each element in the sequence with two parameters: the
expected value and the current item.


## Acessing individual elements

### Function first

    (seq:+Sequence) ↦ *mixed*
    
Returns the first element of the sequence.

Returns `null` if the passed object does not implement the
[Sequence](types.html#function_sequencep) interface.


### Function last

    (seq:+Sequence) ↦ *mixed*
    
Returns the last element of the sequence.

Returns `null` if the passed object does not implement the
[Sequence](types.html#function_sequencep) interface.


### Function nth

    (seq:+Sequence, index:Number) ↦ *mixed*
    
Returns the element at the given index in the sequence.

Returns `null` if the passed object does not implement the
[Sequence](types.html#function_sequence) interface.


### Function find_first

    (seq:+Sequence[, predicate:Function][, context:Object]) ↦ *mixed*
    
Returns the first element of the sequence to pass the predicate test.

If a predicate is not given, the function will return the first non-nil
element from the sequence.

A context may be given as the last argument; if so, the predicate will
be called with the given element as `this`.


### Function find_last

    (seq:+Sequence[, predicate:Function][, context:Object]) ↦ *mixed*
    
Returns the last element of the sequence to pass the predicate
function.

If the predicate is not given, the function will return the last non-nil
element from the sequence.

A context may be given as the last argument; if so, the predicate
function will be called with the given element as `this`.


## Extracting sections of a list

### Function slice

    (seq:+Sequence[, start:Number][, end:Number]) ↦ Array
    
Extracts a subsection of the sequence that goes from `start` to `end`.

When `start` is not given, the algorithm assumes the beginning of the
sequence. When `end` is not given, the algorithm assumes the last item
of the sequence.

At any rate, `start` and `end` are included in the resulting sublist.

If negative indexes are passed as either `start` or `end`, they're taken
as the difference from the length of the sequence. That is, a -1 index
means the last element, -2 the one before the last, and so on.


**Alias for:**

- [Array.prototype.slice][]


### Function rest

    (seq:+Sequence) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array without the first element.


### Function but_last

    (seq:+Sequence) ↦  Array
    
Returns a new array without the last element.


### Function drop

    (seq:+Sequence, num:Number) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array without the first `num` elements.


### Function keep

    (seq:+Sequence, num:Number) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array with just the first `num` elements.


## Extending lists

### Function insert

    (seq:+Sequence, index:Number[, values...]) ↦  Array
    
Returns a new array with the given `values` inserted at the given
`index`.


### Function cat

    (seq:+Sequence[, seqs...]) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array with the given sequences concatenated.


## Structure handling
    
### Function remove

    (seq:+Sequence, index:Number) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array without the item at `index`.


### Function without

    (seq:+Sequence, value[, predicate:Function]) ↦  Array
    
Returns a new array without elements that match `value`, with the
comparison optionally defined by a predicate funciton.

If a predicate function is not given, the strict equality comparison
operator (`===`) will be used.


### Function compact

    (seq:+Sequence) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array without `null` and `undefined` values in it.


### Function replace

    (seq:+Sequence, value, replacement[, predicate:Function]) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array with the elements that match `value` replaced by
`replacement`.

If a predicate function is not given, the strict equality comparison
operator (`===`) will be used.


### Function replace_at

    (seq:+Sequence, index:Number, replacement) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array with the element at `index` replaced by the given
`replacement`.


### Function sorted

     (seq:+Sequence[, comparison:Function]) ↦ Array
     
Returns a new array, sorted according to the comparison function.

If a comparison function is not given, the items will be sorted
lexographically.


### Function reversed

    (seq:+Sequence) ↦ Array
    
Returns the reversed representation of the given sequence.

That is, last items first, first items last.


### Function flatten

    (seq:+Sequence) ↦ Array
    
Returns an one dimensional array by in-lining all sublists.


### Function zip

    (seq:+Sequence) ↦ Array
    
Merges all sequences into one, such that any given index of the
resulting sequence, is a sequence of the values at that index in all of
the given sequences.

**FIXME:**
> Come up with a description that does not suck monkey balls.


## Iteration through a list

### Function map

    (seq:+Sequence, predicate:Function[, context:Object]) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array with the elements transformed by the predicate
function.


### Function each

    (seq:+Sequence, predicate:Function[, context:Object]) ↦ Array
    
Executes the predicate function for each item in the sequence.


### Function filter

    (seq:+Sequence, predicate:Function[, context:Object]) ↦ Array
    
Returns a sequence without the elements that don't pass the predicate
test.


### Function reduce

    (seq:+Sequence, predicate:Function[, initial][, context:Object]) ↦ *mixed*
    
Apply the predicate against each pair in the array (left to right) so to
return a single accumulated value.

An starting value can be given, in which case the function will work as
if the item was inserted as the first element of the given array.


### Function reduce_right

    (seq:+Sequence, predicate:Function[, initial][, context:Object]) ↦ *mixed*
    
Apply the predicate function against each pair in the array (right to
left) so to return a single accumulated value.

An starting value can be given, in which case the function will work as
if the item was inserted as the last element of the given array.


### Function some

    (seq:+Sequence, predicate:Function[, context:Object]) ↦ Boolean
    
Checks whether some element in the sequence passes the predicate test.


### Function every

    (seq:+Sequence, predicate:Function[, context:Object]) ↦ Boolean
    
Checks if all of the elements in the sequence passes the predicate
test.


## Special mapping functions

### Function pluck

    (seq:+Sequence, attribute:String) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array with all elements replaced by their `attribute`s'
value.

Non-object items are mapped to `undefined`.


### Function invoke

    (seq:+Sequence, method:String[, args...]) ↦ Array
    
Returns a new array with all elements replaced by the result of invoking
the given named method for all objects.

Items that have no such method, or that are not objects, will be mapped
to `undefined`.

The method will be called in the context of the object, optionally
passing the additional arguments to it.
